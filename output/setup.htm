<h1>How to Install this Software</h1>

<p>To install this program, insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive.
Within a few seconds, the disc should start spinning and the Setup
program should start.</p>

<p>If your CD-ROM drive does not automatically start the Setup
program, press Ctrl+Esc (or press the Windows key) and press the letter
"R" to open the Run dialog.  At the Run dialog, type d:\setup and press
Enter.  Replace the "d:" with the actual letter of your CD-ROM drive.</p>

<p>If you don't know the letter of your CD-ROM drive, open the My Computer
icon on your desktop, open the CD-ROM drive that contains your program
CD, then open the program Setup.exe.</p>

<p>Once Setup starts, follow the instructions displayed on screen.
Before you can precede with Setup, you must agree to the End User
License Agreement that Setup displays.</p>

<p>Once the software is installed, you will not need the CD to use
the program.</p>

<p>To start the software, find its icon on the desktop, or go to
the Start menu and open the Programs folder.  Use the arrow keys to find
the program's name and press Enter.</p>
